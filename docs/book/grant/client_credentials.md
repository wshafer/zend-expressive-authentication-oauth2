# Client credentials

The client credentials grant is used in machine-to-machine scenarios: for
example, a client making API requests that do not require a user's permission.

The client sends a `POST` request with following body parameters to the
authorization server:

- `grant_type` = client_credentials.
- `client_id` with the client's ID.
- `client_secret` with the client's secret.
- `scope` with a space-delimited list of requested scope permissions.

The authorization server responds with a JSON payload as follows:

```json
{
    "token_type" : "Bearer",
    "expires_in" : "3600",
    "access_token" : "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q..."
}
```

The values returned are as follows:

- The `token_type` is the type of generated token (here, and generally, Bearer).
- `expires_in` is an integer representing the time-to-live (in seconds) of the
  access token.
- The `access_token` contains a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the
  authorization serverâ€™s private key. This token must be used in the
  `Authorization` request HTTP header in subsequent requests.
